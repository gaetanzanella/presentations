- Performing complex logic
- Applying statistics and mathematics
- Conducting advanced full-text searches
- Memorizing information
- Communicating via well-defined protocols

Since 2012, thanks to machine learning techniques, more interactive human-like tasks have become possible:

- Recognizing images
- Creating visual images
- Speaking human languages
- Classifying messages
- Writing in natural languages — and even code

## ✅ AI

- Universal, powerful, historical concept
- Reproducing human like behavior
- Since 2012, ML explodes to create more and more human like programs

## ✅ ML

- Guessing tasks / pattern based on data

## ✅ DL

- ML using deep neural networks

- FOMO
- Defining AI

  - AI is universal
    - AI is old concept, even Platon knows it
    - Examples of Antiquity => power !!
    - != web3
  - The purpose of AI is to reproduce human behaviors
    - Example of Turing
    - Turing + echec
  - AI is not always about computer science
    - Mouse

- Defining AI for developers

  - A developer defines functions
  - A developer has always defined AI
    - A calculus
    - Deep Blue
    - Google
  - Villani quote
  - A developer was limited
    - Image parsing
    - Predictions
    - Speaking
    - Text parsing

- Defining AI for developers since 2016

  - Alex & Machine Learning
  - Machine Learning
    - Reversed function

- END of FOMO
  - AI is a new tool
    - ~sql
